		<h1>What is Tsohci?</h1>
		<p><b>Tsohci</b> ([t͡soː.ci]) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language">experimental</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed
        	language</a> designed to explore the bounds of what a human-usable language can be by using a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first inspired</a> 
		grammar which appears in few if any natural or constructed languages.
		To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that 
		attempts to minimize the number of things a speaker or listener needs to think about.
		The language was developed beginning in late June 2021 following various sketches of
		potential breadth-first languages inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/2407/">xkcd 2407</a>.
		It originally used a modified consonant inventory from unrelated language sketches from December 2020, a
		vowel inventory copied from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, a tone system copied from
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>, and a grammar system heavily inspired by
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">toki pona</a>. By early 2022 most of these influences were largely
		obscured by revisions to the language.
        </p>
		<p>Tsohci is intended to explore many linguistic theories that claim some form of fundamental
		or underlying genetic language or grammar. This language violates most if not all of their proposed
		systems, so if it can be learned to fluency then those theories are likely false. However, Tsohci is a hobby project at best
		and should not be taken seriously enough to be considered actual science. It exists to be interesting and entertaining, so no 
		enforced standard of Tsohci will ever have official support, and speakers will be encouraged to speak how they wish to.

	<div class="printBlock">
		<h2 id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
		<p>Tsohci words are taken from a wide range of languages with the only concerns being whether the word is needed and how much it needs to be modified
		to obey proper morphology. This means that commonly spoken languages like English, Mandarin Chinese, or Spanish are <b>not</b> given special
		consideration and are often passed over entirely. The semantic domains of the borrowed word are also mostly carried over with a small level of 
		modification to remove any wholly disconnected polysemy and to simply appease the desires of whoever is loaning the word.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="printBlock">
		<h3 id="Phrases">Lexical phrases</h3>
		<p>Lexical items in Tsohci are not necessarily a single root, and may instead consist of any syntactically valid (ignoring types)
		construction. These multi word lexical items may also have an equal number of empty spots in their construction and defintions that must be filled when used.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="printBlock">
		<h3 id="Names">Names and loans</h3>
		<p>Loan words, including proper nouns, are typically converted to Tsohci's morphology one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the pronunciation (the more common method)</li>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the spelling (used only when the spelling of the original word is extremely close to being a
			valid as a Tsohci word and the pronunciation of the word is not nearly close to being a valid Tsohci word)</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Additionally, when using the first method, a few specific recommendations may be followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>vowel height distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>voice distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>swapping vowels is preferred to swapping consonants unless the vowel of the word being loaned is a perfect match for a Tsohci vowel.</li>
            <li>diphthongs typically become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel weight or hight change.</li>
            <li>it is preferable to drop a syllable than to gain one unless dropping a syllable would result in a single syllable word</li>
            <li>low tone may be treated as default with dual tones being used to transcribe vowel length, or high tone to transcribe stress</li>
            <li>phonemes less common in Tsohci are preferred to more common ones if the word being borrowed has multiple valid pronunciations in the original language</li>
            <li>unvoiced consonant clusters may become ejectives, and voiced consonant clusters may become implosives</li>
        </ul>

		<h1>Introduction examples</h1>
		<h2 id="Lesson1">Introduction examples</h2>
		<p>Generally a good way to learn a language is to understand the basics, use that basic understanding to learn some vocabulary,
		and as soon as possible start learning via immersion. This language is intentionally designed so that it is difficult to explain
		using tradtional structures, so this document attempts to mirror that learning structure in an attempt at documenting the language.
		So far this document has covered the the basics, the following section indroduces about two hundred peices of vocabulary, with a
		break to introduce the number system in the middle, then a section uses that introductory vocab to teach new words through immersion.</p>

		<p>Remeber that sentence breaks requires exactly two arguments and behaves differently depending on the types of those arguments. 
		In the examples above, those types are a noun followed by a verb, and which means the noun with the verb attached as a relative clause.
		Since the top level of these sentences are noun, the sentences assert that the described noun exist. In other words the first sentence
		might be more accurately translated as "A big cat exists" but since people dont talk like that in English, a slight less accurate,
		but pretty much semantically identical translation is listed instead.</p>

		<p>Soh citih tetsi vu - You like a cat</p>
		<p>Soh vuh tetsi mi - I like you</p>
		<p>Here you can see how a sentence break can be an argument for another sentence break. in these examples the first
		sentence break functions the same as in previous sentences. While the second one has a verb followed by a noun, and as a result acts as
		a verb with the noun incorporated. In other words the first sentence might be more accurately translated as "A me that is cat-liked
		exists", but this is even less like how people speak in English.</p>

		<p>Soh vuh tetsih citi suhri - A big cat like you</p>

		<p>Here we see both our first adverb, as well as our first lexical phrase. Remember an adverb modifies a verb, and a

			<p>numbers less than 100 can be regularly derived by finding the largest irregular digit
			lower than the desired digit with the same final base 10 digit and prefixing it with the appropriate prefix. powers
			of 100 can be constructed by prefixing a number with<i>t́e</i> or <i>t́é</i> (to match the following tone) to take
			a number to the power of 100. All other numbers are made using normal grammar treating numbers 0-99 as verbs, powers
			of 100 as nouns, and using <i>váa</i> to join digits typically from greatest to least. The noun that the final 0-99
			digit is attached to is the thing being counted. negatives are formed by attaching <i>débóo</i> to that unit noun.</p>

		beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst. Pathway's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I

		<p>"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the sergeant-major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>"And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White.</p>

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.</p>

		<p>TRANSLATION</p>
	</div>
	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>The soldier shook his head. "Fancy, I suppose," he said, slowly. "I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't
		think I will. It has caused enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale; some of
		them, and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward."</p>
		<p>TRANSLATION</p>
	</div>

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>"I won't," said his friend, doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens.

	</div>
	<div class="printBlock">

	</div>
	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>"Sounds like the Arabian Nights," said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. "Don't you think you

		<p>TRANSLATION</p>
	</div>
	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>Her husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>"If you must wish," he said, gruffly, "wish for something sensible."</p>

	</div>
	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of

	<div class="printBlock">
		<p>"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us," said Herbert, as the

	</div>
