		<h1>Hýyban</h1>
		<p><b>Hýyban</b> (<i>/çə˦.ə˨.bä˨n/</i>) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language">experimental</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed
        	language</a> designed to explore the bounds of what a human-usable language can be by using a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a> 
		grammar which appears in few if any natural or constructed languages.
		To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that 
		attempts to minimize the number of things a speaker or listener needs to think about.
		The language was developed beginning in late June 2021 following various sketches of
		potential breadth-first languages inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/2407/">xkcd 2407</a>.
		It originally used a modified consonant inventory from unrelated language sketches from December 2020, a
		vowel inventory copied from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, a tone system copied from
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>, and a grammar system heavily inspired by
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">toki pona</a>. By early 2022 most of these influences were largely
		obscured by changes to the language.
        </p>
		<p>Hýyban is intended to explore many linguistic theories that claim some form of fundamental
		or underlying genetic language or grammar. This language violates most if not all of their proposed
		systems, so if it can be learned to fluency then those theories are likely false. However, Hýyban is a hobby project at best
		and should not be taken seriously enough to be considered actual science. It exists to be interesting and entertaining, so no 
		enforced standard of Hýyban will ever have official support, and speakers will be encouraged to speak how they wish to.

		<p>Syllables in Hýyban are of the form CV(N), i.e. consonant + vowel (accompanied by tone) + optional final nasal stop.</p>
		<p>Word weight in Hýyban is crucial to understanding word boundaries and can be calculated by adding up the total number of front
		vowels, voiced consonants, and dual tones. Syllables bind to the prior syllables to form multisyllabic
		words if the prior syllables collectively weigh less than two. 
		When the collective weight of the syllables becomes two or more, the word ends and a new word can begin.

		<h2 id="Writing">Writing systems</h2>
		<p>Hýyban is written using the Latin script. With capitalization only on the first letter of every sentence.
		The word "e" may be written as a dot (‧), otherwise punctuation does not appear.
		The acute accent may be written as an apostrophe following the letter its attached to. "ı" and "ȷ" may be written as 
		"i" and "j" respectively if needed. The acute accent is considered its own letter.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Grammar">Grammar</h2>
		<!---<p>Hýyban has a mostly free constituent word order, with the topic of the clause coming at the beginning of the sentence.
		Further complicating things leaves do not fall into well-defined parts of speech, so they may be used as nouns, verbs, modifiers, or interjections.</p>
		--->
		<h3 id="Syntax">Syntax</h3>
		<p>Hýyban grammar is syntactically very simple, relying on only a handful of rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"eén" is a contraction of "eé e".</li>
            <li>"eé" is a contractin of "e e".</li>
            <li>"e" always requires exactly two arguments and other words never accept any arguments.</li>
            <li>Words are fill the <u><b style="font-size:20px;">oldest</b></u> unfilled argument slot.</li>
            <li>Only certain combinations of word types may legally fill the slots of an "e".</li>
        </ul>
		
		
		<h3 id="SyntacticCategories">Syntactic category combinations</h3>
		<p>Lexical items may be conjunctions, adverbs, nouns, or verbs.</p>
		<p>Below are possible combinations of types the aruments of "e" may be, followed by "↦", the type it acts as, ":", and a description of the semantics.</p>
		<p>noun, verb ↦ noun: noun which does verb.</p>
		<p>verb (must be transitive), noun ↦ verb: verb is done to noun.</p>
		<p>conjunction, any type ↦ CP: used in the following rule.</p>
		<p>any type, CP (must contain the same type) ↦ the same type: conjoins two of the same types.</p>
		<p>verb, verb ↦ verb: both verbs are part of one holistic event.</p>
		<p>verb, adverb ↦ verb: verbs happens in an adverb manner.</p>
		<p>adverb, adverb ↦ adverb: 1st adverb is true in a 2nd adverb manner.</p>
		<p style="background-color:#F99">This is a WIP list and doesnt have anything like numerals defined</p>
		
		<h2 id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
		<p>Hýyban words are taken from a wide range of languages with the only concerns being whether the word is needed and how much it needs to be modified
		to obey proper morphology. This means that commonly spoken languages like English, Mandarin Chinese, or Spanish are <b>not</b> given special
		consideration and are often passed over entirely. The semantic domains of the borrowed word are also mostly carried over with a small level of 
		modification to remove any wholly disconnected polysemy and to simply appease the desires of whoever is loaning the word.</p>
		<h3 id="Phrases">Lexical phrases</h3>
		<p>Lexical items in Hýyban are not necicarily a single root, and may instead consist of any syntactically valid (ignoring types) contruction.</p>
		<h3 id="Names">Names and loans</h3>
		<p>Loan words, including proper nouns, are typically converted to Hýyban's morphology one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the pronunciation (the more common method)</li>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the spelling (used only when the spelling of the original word is extremely close to being a
			valid as a Hýyban word and the pronunciation of the word is not nearly close to being a valid Hýyban word)</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Additionally, when using the first method, a few specific recommendations may be followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a and y may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>vowel frontness distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>glottal stop and j may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>voice distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>swapping vowels is preferred to swapping consonants unless the vowel of the word being loaned is a perfect match for a Hýyban vowel.</li>
            <li>diphthongs may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel weight change of the diphthong (au =&gt; áa)</li>
            <li>if diphthongs are comprised of vowels sharing a weight they may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel height change of the diphthong (ai =&gt; aá)</li>
            <li>it is preferable to drop a syllable than to gain one unless dropping a syllable would result in a single syllable word</li>
            <li>low tone may be treated as default with dual tones being used to transcribe vowel length, or high tone to transcribe stress</li>
            <li>phonemes less common in Hýyban are preferred to more common ones if the word being borrowed has multiple valid pronunciations in the orginal language</li>
            <li>unvoiced consonant clusters may become ejectives, and voiced consonant clusters may become implosives</li>
        </ul>
