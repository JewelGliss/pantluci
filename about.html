		<h1>Hýyban</h1>
		<p><b>Hýyban</b> (<i>/çə˦.ə˨.bä˨n/</i>) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language">experimental</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed
        	language</a> designed to explore the bounds of what a human-usable language can be by using a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a> 
		grammar which appears in few if any natural or constructed languages.
		To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that 
		attempts to minimize the number of things a speaker or listener needs to think about.
		The language was developed beginning in late June 2021 following various sketches of
		potential breadth-first languages inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/2407/">xkcd 2407</a>.
		It uses a modified consonant inventory from unrelated language sketches from December 2020, a
		vowel inventory copied from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, a tone system copied from
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>, and the grammar system is heavily inspired by
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">toki pona</a>.
        </p>
		<p>Hýyban is intended to explore many linguistic theories that claim some form of fundamental
		or underlying genetic language or grammar. This language violates most if not all of their proposed
		systems, so if it can be learned to fluency then those theories are likely false. However, Hýyban is a hobby project at best
		and should not be taken seriously enough to be considered actual science. It exists to be interesting and entertaining, so no 
		enforced standard of Hýyban will ever have official support, and speakers will be encouraged to speak how they wish to.

		<p>Syllables in Hýyban are of the form CV(N), i.e. consonant + vowel (accompanied by tone) + optional final nasal stop.</p>
		<p>Word weight in Hýyban is crucial to understanding word boundaries and can be calculated by adding up the total number of front
		vowels, voiced consonants, and dual tones. Syllables bind to the prior syllables to form multisyllabic
		words if the prior syllables collectively weigh less than two. 
		When the collective weight of the syllables becomes two or more, the word ends and a new word can begin.

		<h2 id="Writing">Writing systems</h2>
		<p>Hýyban has two main writing systems, the Latin script and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duployan_shorthand">Duployan shorthand</a>.</p>
		<p>Hýyban written with the Latin script lacks both punctuation and capitalization, except for the first letter of each sentence,
		which is always capitalized. Additionally, the acute accent may be written as an apostrophe following the letter its attached to. "ı" and "ȷ" may be written as 
		"i" and "j" respectively in a pinch.</p>
		<p>The acute accent is considered its own letter.</p>
		<p>Hýyban in Duployan shorthand typically uses spaces only places spaces where a sharp corner would otherwise be created,
		or where convient to the writer. Otherwise, letters are generally written immediately at the end of the previous
		letter without lifting or repositioning the pen.</p>

		<h2 id="Grammar">Grammar</h2>
		<!---<p>Hýyban has a mostly free constituent word order, with the topic of the clause coming at the beginning of the sentence.
		Further complicating things leaves do not fall into well-defined parts of speech, so they may be used as nouns, verbs, modifiers, or interjections.</p>
		--->
		<h3 id="Syntax">Syntax</h3>
		<p>Hýyban grammar is syntactically very simple, relying on only a handful of rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Particles always accept exactly two arguments, prefixes always accept exactly one argument, and leaves never accept any arguments.</li>
            <li>Words are assigned as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">tail</a> to the <u><b style="font-size:20px;">oldest</b></u> unfilled argument slot.</li>
            <li>A sentence with remaining unfilled slots is grammatically incorrect until all the slots are filled at which point the sentence becomes finished.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3 id="Semantics">Semantics</h3>
		<p>Hýyban was designed so that the majority of the grammatical weight lies on the vocabulary. As a result, while the syntax of Hýyban is
		very straightforward, its semantics are less so. Sentences can be analyzed as recursively simplifying, with the final result being asserted 
		as contextually significant. In more simple terms, a sentence like <i>I nı́n suroó</i> may be translated as either "You ask." or
		"question that you posed" This is important when considering embedded clauses like in <i>I mı lı́ ı sagó nı́n suroó</i> which may be translated as
		"I reply to you asking a question." or "I answer your question."</p>
		<p>A rough approximation of prepositons in many languages can be constructed using <i>e</i> with a complicated clause as the
		first argument. For example <i>I mı e lı́ tı́go hýyban cıı́n</i> could be translated as "I speak using Hýyban." or "I (using Hýyban)ly speak." Or,
		<i>I mı e keé ódo dómo run</i> could be translated as "I eat at home." or "I (location of home)ly eat." This rough structure is also used for
		ordinals, <i>Keé wán da fýyré</i> could mean "The second person." or "The person of one before."
		</p>
		<h3 id="Prefixes">Prefixes</h3>
		<p>Hýyban prefixes are not true prefixes, instead, they take a single argument and convert it into another semantic concept.</p>
		<p><b>ceé</b> - 6 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>dı́ı</b> - 2 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>dón</b> - 5 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>fı́ı</b> - 4 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>huma</b> - asks whether a clause should be negated</p>
		<p><b>ȷéro</b> - 0 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>la</b> - negates a clause</p>
		<p><b>nı́ı</b> - does nothing, used to prevent lexical phrases forming</p>
		<p><b>pará</b> - converts a clause into a semantically adjacent meaning</p>
		<p><b>sı́byn</b> - 7 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>sı́ı</b> - emphasizes a clause</p>
		<p><b>sı́wa</b> - 9 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>sókale</b> - refers to a concept by its typical description regardless of its truth value (including nonce loans)</p>
		<p><b>tıı́</b> - 3 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>wán</b> - 1 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>wyru</b> - 8 of the clause</p>
		<p><b>an</b> - turns a clause into a name</p>
		<p><b>un</b> - converts a clause into a semantically opposite meaning</p>
		<h3 id="Particles">Particles</h3>
		<p>Hýyban particles are very similar to its prefixes, but they take two arguments instead of one.</p>
		<p><b>cı́ı</b> - the first clause and/or the second clause</p>
		<p><b>keé</b> - attaches the first clause as an associate to the second</p>
		<p><b>ȷaá</b> - attaches the second clause with the agentive case to the second</p>
		<p><b>kalu</b> - the second clause, supposing the first clause is true</p>
		<p><b>lı́</b> - attaches the first clause with the patientive case to the second</p>
		<p><b>reé</b> - attaches the second clause with the patientive case to the first</p>
		<p><b>e</b> - attaches the first clause as a modifier to the second</p>
		<p><b>ı</b> - attaches the first clause with the agentive case to the second</p>
		<p>When one of the case particles (<i>ȷaá</i>, <i>lı́</i>, <i>reé</i>, or <i>ı</i>) are placed in the second slot of
		a case particle, they can be analyzed as currying their first argument into the nested particle.
		This can be prevented with nı́ı.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
		<p>Particles and prefixes are a closed class of words, while leaves and lexical phrases are an open class of words.</p>
		<p>Hýyban words are taken from a wide range of languages with the only concerns being whether the word is needed and how much it needs to be modified
		to obey proper morphology. This means that commonly spoken languages like English, Mandarin Chinese, or Spanish are <b>not</b> given special
		consideration and are often passed over entirely. The semantic domains of the borrowed word are also mostly carried over with a small level of 
		modification to remove any wholly disconnected polysemy and to simply appease the desires of whoever is loaning the word.</p>
		<h3 id="Phrases">Lexical phrases</h3>
		<p>Certain grammatical constructs in Hýyban are assigned dictionary definitions that replace the literal interpretation of the
		phrase. For example, <i>huma cı́ı</i> literally means "is it true that either ... or ...." but is overridden by a lexical phrase and instead
		acts as an interrogative "or". To get the literal interpretation <i>nı́ı</i> is typically inserted to prevent the lexical phrase from forming.</p>
		<h3 id="Numbers">Numbers</h3>
		<p>Hýyban numbers are a special set of infinite lexical phrases formed out of only the following starting with the largest digit:</p>
		<p><b>ȷéro</b> - digit 0</p>
		<p><b>wán</b> - digit 1</p>
		<p><b>dı́ı</b> - digit 2</p>
		<p><b>tıı́</b> - digit 3</p>
		<p><b>fı́ı</b> - digit 4</p>
		<p><b>dón</b> - digit 5</p>
		<p><b>ceé</b> - digit 6</p>
		<p><b>sı́byn</b> - digit 7</p>
		<p><b>wyru</b> - digit 8</p>
		<p><b>sı́wa</b> - digit 9</p>
		<p>For example, <i>fı́ı dı́ı da</i> means "fourty-two people," and <i>fı́ı nı́ı dı́ı da</i> means "four groups of two people."</p>
		<h3 id="Colors">Colors</h3>
		<p>Hýyban uses a CMYK color model; this means the primary color words are <i>buú</i> (cyan), <i>haá</i> (magenta), <i>tée</i>
		(yellow), and <i>xoón</i> (black). Additionally, there is a secondary color word for every pair of primary colors. Notably absent
		is a word for white, instead <i>tı́ı</i> a word meaning something along the lines of "undyed" or "color-free" is used.</p>
		<h3 id="Names">Names and loans</h3>
		<p>Loan words, including proper nouns, are typically converted to Hýyban's morphology one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the pronunciation (the more common method)</li>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the spelling (used only when the spelling of the original word is extremely close to being a
			valid as a Hýyban word and the pronunciation of the word is not nearly close to being a valid Hýyban word)</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Additionally, when using the first method, a few special guidelines may be followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a and y may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>vowel frontness distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>glottal stop and j may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>voice distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>swapping vowels is preferred to swapping consonants unless the vowel of the word being loaned is a perfect match for a Hýyban vowel.</li>
            <li>diphthongs may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel weight change of the diphthong (au =&gt; áa)</li>
            <li>if diphthongs are comprised of vowels sharing a weight they may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel height change of the diphthong (ai =&gt; aá)</li>
            <li>it is preferable to drop a syllable than to gain one unless dropping a syllable would result in a single syllable word</li>
            <li>low tone may be treated as default with dual tones being used to transcribe vowel length, or high tone to transcribe stress</li>
            <li>rarer phonemes are preferred to more common ones if the language being borrowed from has multiple valid pronunciations</li>
            <li>unvoiced consonant clusters may become ejectives, and voiced consonant clusters may become implosives</li>
            <li>any of these may be ignored if the result does not sound right</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Names must be the grammatical tail of the prefix <i>an</i>.</p>
		<p>Nonce loans must be the grammatical tail of the prefix <i>sókale</i>.</p>
