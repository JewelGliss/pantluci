		<h1>Hýyban</h1>
		<p><b>Hýyban</b> (<i>/çə˦.ə˨.bä˨n/</i>) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language">experimental</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed
        language</a> designed to explore the bounds of what a human-usable language can be by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a> 
		grammar which appears in few if any natural or constructed languages.
		To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that 
		attempts to minimize the number of things a speaker or listener needs to think about.
		The language was developed beginning in late June 2021 following various sketches of
		potential breadth-first languages inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/2407/">xkcd 2407</a>.
		It uses a modified consonant inventory from unrelated language sketches from December 2020, a
		vowel inventory copied from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, and a tone system copied from
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>.
        </p>
		<p>Hýyban is intended to explore many linguistic theories that claim some form of fundamental
		or underlying genetic language or grammar. This language violates most if not all of their proposed
		systems, so if it can be learned to fluency then those theories are likely false. However, Hýyban is a hobby project at best
		and should not be taken seriously enough to be considered actual science. It exists to be interesting and entertaining, so no 
		enforced standard of Hýyban will ever have official support, and speakers will be encouraged to speak how they wish to.
        </p>

		<h3>Morphology</h3>
		<p>Syllables in Hýyban are of the form CV(N), i.e. consonant + vowel (accompanied by tone) + optional final nasal stop.</p>
		<p>Word weight in Hýyban is crucial to understanding word boundaries and can be calculated by adding up the total number of front
		vowels plus /ä/, voiced consonants minus /j/ plus /ʔ/, and dual tones. Syllables bind to the prior syllables to form multisyllabic
		words if the prior syllables collectively weigh less than two. 
		When the collective weight of the syllables becomes two or more, the word ends and a new word can begin.
		</p>
		<h3>Allophony and Phonotactics</h3>
		<p>The nasal at the end of a syllable is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)">assimilated</a> to the following
		consonant's place of articulation and must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissimilation">dissimilated</a> away from the following 
		consonant's place of articulation if the following consonant is a nasal.</p>
		<p>/xu/, /çi/, /wu˨.u˦/, and /wu˦.u˨/ are illegal sequences.</p>
		<p>The same vowel may not occur on both sides of a glottal stop word internally.</p>
		<p>/i˨.i˦/ is realized as [ji˨˦] unless it follows /ʔ/, /l/, or [s].</p>
		<p>/i˦.i˨/ is realized as [jə˦˨] unless it follows /ʔ/, /l/, or [s].</p>
		<p>/a˨.a˦/ is realized as [ai̯˨˦].</p>
		<p>/a˦.a˨/ is realized as [au̯˦˨].</p>
		<p>/ɛ˨.ɛ˦/ is realized as [ɛi̯˨˦].</p>
		<p>/j/ is realized as [ʒ] before /i/ or /ɛ/ unless it follows [g], [k], [kʼ], [p], [b], or [ʃ].</p>
		<p>/ʔi/ is realized as [ʔji].</p>
		<p>[ʒj] is realized as [ʑ] before [j].</p>
		<p>[ʃj] is realized as [ɕ] before [j].</p>
		<p>[tj] is realized as [t͡ʃ].</p>
		<p>[tʼj] is realized as [t͡<span style="letter-spacing: 2px;">ʃ</span>ʼ].</p>
		<p>[dj] is realized as [d͡ʒ].</p>
		<p>[nj] is realized as [ɲ].</p>
		<p>/k/, /kʼ/, and /g/ is pronounced as palatal before [j].</p>
		
		<h2>Writing systems</h2>
		<p>Hýyban has two main writing systems, the Latin script and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duployan_shorthand">Duployan shorthand</a>.</p>
		<p>Hýyban written with the Latin script lacks both punctuation and capitalization, except for the first letter of each sentence,
		which is always capitalized.Additionally, the acute accent may be written as an apostrophe following the letter its attached to. "ı" and "ȷ" may be written as 
		"i" and "j" respectively in a pinch.</p>
		<p>The acute accent is considered its own letter.</p>
		<p>Hýyban in Duployan shorthand typically uses spaces only places spaces where a sharp corner would otherwise be created,
		or where convient to the writer. Otherwise, letters are generally written immediately at the end of the previous
		letter without lifting or repositioning the pen.</p>

        </ul>
		<h2>Grammar</h2>
		<p>Hýyban has a mostly free constituent word order, although it is always "verb-final", with the topic of the clause coming at the beginning of the sentence.
		Further complicating things leaves do not fall into well-defined parts of speech, so they may be used as nouns, verbs, modifiers, or interjections.</p>
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
		<p>Hýyban grammar is syntactically very simple, relying on only a handful of rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Particles always accept exactly two arguments, prefixes always accept exactly one argument, and leaves never accept any arguments.</li>
            <li>Words are assigned as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">tail</a> to the <u><b style="font-size:20px;">oldest</b></u> unfilled argument slot.</li>
            <li>A sentence with remaining unfilled slots is grammatically incorrect until all the slots are filled at which point the sentence becomes finished.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Semantics</h3>
		<p>Hýyban was designed so that the majority of the grammatical weight lies on the vocabulary. As a result, while the syntax of Hýyban is
		very straightforward its semantics are less so. Sentences can be analyzed as recursively simplifying, with the final result being asserted 
		as contextually significant. In more simple terms, a sentence like <i>I nín suroó</i> may be translated as either "You ask." or
		"question that you posed" This is important when considering embedded clauses like in <i>I mi lí i sagó nín suroó</i> which may be translated as
		"I reply to you asking a question." or "I answer your question."</p>
		<h3>Prefixes</h3>
		<p>Hýyban prefixes are not true prefixes, instead, they take a single argument and convert it into another semantic concept.</p>
		<p><b>la</b> - negates a clause</p>
		<p><b>níi</b> - does nothing, used to prevent lexical phrases forming</p>
		<p><b>síi</b> - emphasizes a clause</p>
		<p><b>huma</b> - questions whether a clause is negated</p>
		<p><b>an</b> - turns a clause into a name</p>
		<h3>Particles</h3>
		<p><b>cíi</b> - the first leaf and/or the second leaf</p>
		<p><b>gen</b> - attaches the first leaf with the genetive case to the second</p>
		<p><b>jií</b> - attaches the first leaf with the dative case to the second</p>
		<p><b>lí</b> - attaches the first leaf with the patientive case to the second</p>
		<p><b>reé</b> - indicates that the patient of the first leaf is the second</p>
		<p><b>e</b> - attaches the first leaf as a modifier to the second</p>
		<p><b>i</b> - attaches the first leaf with the agentive case to the second</p>
		<p><b>???</b> - indicates that the agent of the first leaf is the second</p>
		<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
		<p>Particles and prefixes are a closed class of words, while leaves and lexical phrases are an open class of words.</p>
		<h3>Lexical phrases</h3>
		<p>Certain grammatical constructs in Hýyban are assigned dictionary definitions that replace the literal interpretation of the
		phrase. For example, <i>xuma cí i</i> literally means "is it true that either ... or ...." but is overridden by a lexical phrase and instead
		acts as an interrogative "or". To get the literal interpretation <i>qon</i> is typically inserted to prevent the lexical phrase from forming.</p>
		<p>Hýyban words are taken from a wide range of languages with the only concerns being whether the word is needed and how much it needs to be modified
		to obey proper morphology. This means that commonly spoken languages like English, Mandarin Chinese, or Spanish are <b>not</b> given special
		consideration and are often passed over entirely. The semantic domains of the borrowed word are also mostly carried over with a small level of 
		modification to remove any wholly disconnected polysemy and to simply appease the desires of whoever is loaning the word.</p>
		<h3>Colors</h3>
		<p>Hýyban uses a CMYK color model; this means the primary color words are <i>buú</i> (cyan), <i>haá</i> (magenta), <i>tée</i>
		(yellow), and <i>xoón</i> (black). Additionally, there is a secondary color word for every pair of primary colors. Notably absent
		is a word for white, instead <i>tíi</i> a word meaning something along the lines of "undyed" or "color-free" is used.</p>
		<h3>Names and loans</h3>
		<p>Loan words, including proper nouns, are typically converted to Hýyban's morphology one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the pronunciation (the more common method)</li>
            <li>attempting to maximize the recognizability of the spelling (used only when the spelling of the original word is extremely close to being a
			valid as a Hýyban word and the pronunciation of the word is not nearly close to being a valid Hýyban word)</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Additionally, when using the first method, a few special guidelines may be followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a and y may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>vowel frontness distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>glottal stop and j may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>voice distinctions may be swapped to manipulate the weight of the syllables</li>
            <li>swapping vowels is preferred to swapping consonants unless the vowel of the word being loaned is a perfect match for a Hýyban vowel.</li>
            <li>diphthongs may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel weight change of the diphthong (au =&gt; áa)</li>
            <li>if diphthongs are comprised of vowels sharing a weight they may become dual tones inheriting their first vowel and rising or lowering depending on the vowel height change of the diphthong (ai =&gt; aá)</li>
            <li>it is preferable to drop a syllable than to gain one unless dropping a syllable would result in a single syllable word</li>
            <li>low tone may be treated as default with dual tones being used to transcribe vowel length, or high tone to transcribe stress</li>
            <li>rarer phonemes are preferred to more common ones if the language being borrowed from has multiple valid pronunciations</li>
            <li>any of these may be ignored if the result does not sound right</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Names must be the grammatical tail of the prefix <i>an</i>.</p>
