# Syntax

HÃ½yban's grammar is syntactically very simple, relying on only a handful of rules.

+ Particles always accept exactly two arguments; and non-particles, also called leaves, never accept any arguments.

+ Words are assigned as a tail to the ***oldest*** unfilled argument slot.

+ A sentence with remaining unfilled slots is grammatically incorrect until all the slots are filled at which point the sentence becomes finished.
