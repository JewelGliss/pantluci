# Introduction

**Hýyban** \(\/çəː˦˨bä˨n\/\) is a [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) that aims to explore the bounds of what a
 human-usable language can be by using a [breadth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) grammar which appears in few if any
 natural or constructed languages. To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that attempts to minimize the number of things a
 speaker or listener needs to think about.
 
 This book will provide an introductory tour of the language, covering its syntax and semantics. **It will not teach fluency** or likely even
 proficiency of the language, but it will teach enough for an introduction to the language, or a quick reference.

Hýyban is **not** a [loglang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_language), 
[auxlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language), or even a [fictlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language).
 It is an [experimental language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language) intended to explore many linguistic theories that claim some
 form of fundamental or underlying genetic language or grammar. This language violates most if not all of their proposed systems, so if it can be
 learned to fluency then those theories are likely false.
 
Hýyban is described in this book, but speakers will not be forced to conform to these rules or any others. As long as they are understood by other speakers
 of Hýyban and the language remains breadth-first, it is valid and correct Hýyban.
 
In this book, Hýyban sentences don't use punctuation marks. To make reading without punctuation easier; the first word in each sentence, and no other, is
 capitalized. This is the official way to format things but like the other rules outlined here, a community that develops around this language can decide
 to change it.
