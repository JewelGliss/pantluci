Pantluci (English [pænˈt(ʃ)ɹuː.ki]; Pantluci [ˈpăn.t͡ʃɹʊ.ci]) is an experimental constructed language designed to explore the bounds of what a human-usable language can be by using a breadth-first inspired grammar which appears in few if any natural or constructed languages. To make up for the unfamiliarity, it uses a largely simple grammar that attempts to minimize the number of things a speaker or listener needs to think about.

It went through the names Hýyban ([çə˦.ə˨.bä˨n]), Hoóban ([çoi̯˨˦.bä˨n]), Hoóba ([çoi̯˨˦.bä˨]), Tsohci ([t͜soː.cʰi]), and now Pantluci

Pantlucian grammar is syntactically very simple, relying on only a handful of rules.

A "node" is an imaginary word that is inserted before words depending on vowel alteration.
- Nodes always require exactly two arguments and other words never accept any arguments.
- Words always fill the ***oldest*** unfilled argument slot.
- Only certain combinations of word types may legally fill the slots of a node.
